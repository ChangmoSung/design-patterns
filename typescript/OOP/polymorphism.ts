// Polymorphism - One superclass having many forms
// Like USB type. There are many device types but most of them use USB-C type
// I can execute different implementations for the same method
// 1. Reusability - Write code that can work with different object types
// e,g,. calculateTotalArea is used for Circle and Rectangle
// and can also be used for another new shape and so on
// 2. Interface Consistency - Maintain a consistent interface across different types of objects
// 3. Robustness - Handle a wide variety of situations
// 4. Reduced complexity
